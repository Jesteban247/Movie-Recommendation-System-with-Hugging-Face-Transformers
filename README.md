# 🎥 Movie Recommendation System with Hugging Face Transformers 🚀

Welcome to the **Movie Recommendation System** project! In this project, we use **Hugging Face Transformers** to build an intelligent recommendation system based on movie **genres** and **descriptions**. The system uses powerful embeddings to suggest movies that best match your input query.

## 🔍 What are we doing?
We are building a **Movie Recommendation System** using **Hugging Face's all-MiniLM-L6-v2** model, a fast and efficient embedding model for encoding movie descriptions and genres.

## 💾 Dataset
The movie data is sourced from the [IMDB dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/PromptCloudHQ/imdb-data) on Kaggle. It contains essential information about movies, such as:
- **Title**
- **Genre**
- **Description**
- **Rating**

## 🧠 Model
We leverage the **all-MiniLM-L6-v2** model from Hugging Face's `sentence-transformers` to create embeddings of movie descriptions and genres, allowing the system to find the most relevant movies for any query.

## 🎯 Goal
Simply run the Colab cells, enter a query (e.g., "Sci-Fi movies with spaceships"), and get personalized movie recommendations!
